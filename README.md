# WineScraper

This is a gem for scraping lists of wine and prices from various websites.

It is currently set up for listing Red Wines from the [*The Corkscrew*](http://www.thecorkscrew.ie/red-wine.html?limit=all) website. It can very easily be edited to list different types of wines and use different source websites.  It has been tested with [*Cases Wine Warehouse*](http://www.cases.ie/) and [*TESCO WINE by the case*](http://www.tesco.com/wine/).

It is envisaged that this application can be integrated with a larger app in order to grab information about wines and store them in a database for comparison purposes.

## Installation

    gem 'wine-scraper'
