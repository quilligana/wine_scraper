# WineScraper

This is a gem for scraping lists of wine and their corresponding prices from various websites.

It is currently set up for listing Red Wines from the [*The Corkscrew*](http://www.thecorkscrew.ie/) website. It is currently being edited to list different types of wines and use different source websites.  It has been tested with [*Cases Wine Warehouse*](http://www.cases.ie/) and [*TESCO WINE by the case*](http://www.tesco.com/wine/).

It is envisaged that this application can be integrated with a larger app in order to grab information about wines and store them in a database for comparison purposes.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'wine_scraper'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install wine_scraper

## Usage

The following example shows how to extract an array of red wines from [*thecorkscrew.ie*](http://www.thecorkscrew.ie/). The extrated array holds information on wine names, prices, stock availability and a short description.

```red_wines = wine_scrape(corkscrew, red)```

## Testing

RSpec has been added as a default task in the Rakefile so just run `rake`
